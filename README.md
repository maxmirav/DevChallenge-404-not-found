## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot.PNG)

Was dipping my toes into Flexbox again. Had to relearn a lot of things since I haven't done any web programming at all for the last six months. 

Used a lot of percentages(%) when it comes to sizes and spacings, plus I'm pretty sure I have a lot of unnecessary CSS in there, but I think I did okay.

### Built With
